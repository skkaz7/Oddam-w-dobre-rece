## General Information
  ### What problem does the project solve?
- The user has things in their home that they want to get rid of, but don't know how.
- There are many solutions available, but many of them require extra effort or are not trusted.
- Verified places have to be travelled to and there is no time/no way to go there, and the containers under the house or local collections are unverified and you don't know if these things will actually get to those in need.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
